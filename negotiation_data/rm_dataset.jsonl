Agent A, in turn, will handle the app's technical maintenance, updates, and further development, allowing us to scale and expand the app efficiently.

{"prompt": "A: You're considering various revenue-sharing models, but I'm concerned that a 50-50 split may not be the best fit given our differing areas of expertise and resources invested so far.

A tiered system could work, but I'd want to see more value in my marketing efforts being reflected in the early stages of the app's revenue growth.

This is not a hard number, but it reflects a balance between your technical expertise and my marketing prowess. Additionally, I propose that A handles the ongoing development of the app, with B focusing on ongoing digital marketing efforts to drive user acquisition.
